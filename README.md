Drill Guide - ¾" Dowel Drill Guides
===================================

This repository contains
[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)
source files suitable for 3-D printing a jig designed to drill coaxial 
pilot holes into the ends of two or more ¾" hardwood dowel, so they can 
be joined together with ¼" dowel screws; and to drill a pilot hole for
a #8 wood screw, which will affix a window opening hook on one dowel end.

Motivation
----------

My building has very tall living room windows, which have awning windows
very high up, about 12' high. The windows open outwards, providing nice
airflow in the warm California summer. The locking levers on the window
feature small holes designed to be actuated by a
[transom window hook](http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Line-Products-172655-Transom-Window/dp/B00EO8YI6G)
mounted on a long ¾" diameter pole.

It turns out to be very difficult to find ¾" diameter poles in a length 
as long as 8–10'. However, it is straightforward to find 4' long 
hardwood dowels, which could then be joined together end to end using
[dowel screws](http://www.mcfeelys.com/screws-fasteners/hanger-bolts-dowel-screws/dowel-screws/1-4-x-1-1-2-dowel-dry-lube-screw-qty-10-8vx40.html).

Drilling straight coaxial holes in the ends of dowels is quite 
difficult, and usually requires a drill press and a custom jig. The 3-D 
models in this repository are designed to create small plastic or metal 
drill guides and support struts so a ¾" diameter dowel can be clamped 
down onto a flat table, and then have straight coaxial and side holes 
drilled into it with a hand drill.
