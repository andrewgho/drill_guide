drill_guide - 3/4" dowel drill guides
-------------------------------------

This repository contains plans for a jig designed to drill coaxial pilot 
holes into the ends of two or more 3/4" hardwood dowel, so they can be 
joined together with 1/4" dowel screws; and to drill a pilot hole for a 
#8 wood screw, which will affix a window opening hook on one dowel end.
